DESCRIPTION


This website utilized two major JavaScript libraries: D3.js and moment.js.

For D3.js, we used it to create the charts and bind data with visual elements. For moment.js, we used it to change the format of time to cater our needs.

For the server side, we used ajax to query data from the server so that we can get different dataset at the same time.

d3.queue -- initialize the tweet section, the line chart section, and the summary section, bind the visual elements with our dataset.

brushed() -- give the line chart with brush and link function.

zoomed() -- give the line chart with zoom function.
